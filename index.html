          <h2>Why Open Source our code?</h2>
          <p>Over the last few years, open source has taken the software industry by storm. The UK Government now has clear guidance to open source software, and the DVLA are moving toward a open source model for its new digital transformation programme.</p>

          <p>The DVLA is developing its new government services on top of open source technologies and libraries, including Linux, Scala, Java, Python, Ruby. It is clear from the functionality that we get from open source code, that open source works. Therefore, it is healthy for a heavy user of open source to be part of the community that we take part in.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Exemplar Programmes within the DVLA</h2>

          <p>The DVLA is undergoing a digital transformation, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transformation">Digital Exemplars</a> are the beginning of that journey. Exemplars will be open sourcing their code, and the <a href="https://github.com/dvla/">DVLA Github organisation</a> contains the current ones.</p>

          <h3>Vehicles Management Exemplars</h3>

          <p>Vehicles <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transformation/manage-vehicle">https://www.gov.uk/transformation/manage-vehicle</a><br>
          Personalised Registrations <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transformation/personalised-number-plates">https://www.gov.uk/transformation/personalised-number-plates</a></p>

          <p>The vehicles Exemplar has 34 git repositories, and currently have open sourced 6 of those. Of the code open sourced, there are 22260 lines of Scala code, some Javascript, Ruby and Python. Our projects are as follows:</p>

          <ul>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dvla/vehicles-online">https://github.com/dvla/vehicles-online</a> is a web application which allows motor traders to dispose their vehicles to the trade. It is written in Scala and the Play framework</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dvla/vrm-retention-online">https://github.com/dvla/vrm-retention-online</a> is a web application which allows personalised registrations to be taken off cars and retained by the owner. It is written in Scala and Play.</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dvla/os-address-lookup">https://github.com/dvla/os-address-lookup</a> is micro-service for looking up addresses in the Ordnance Survey service using a postcode or a UPRN. Requires purchasing an API key from Ordnance Survey</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dvla/proxypy">https://github.com/dvla/proxypy</a> is a distributed, highly available rate-limited proxy server written in Python. It is used for throttling HTTP requests within our micro service architecture</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dvla/vehicles-services-common">https://github.com/dvla/vehicles-services-common</a> contains common code used across the vehicle micro-services, which are written in Scala and Spray</li>
            <li><a href="https://github.com/dvla/vcloud-management-tools">https://github.com/dvla/vcloud-management-tools</a> is one of a number of build automation libraries we have. It is a vcloud-rest wrapper that allows us to interact with vmware vcloud providers such as skyscape</li>

          <h2>Will the code be useful for other people?</h2>

          <p>Much of this code is specific to government services, and therefore will see reuse within the government. Some utility libraries, such as proxypy might be useful for a more general audience. In some cases, the code might be useful for developers to see how another team has approached solved a specific problem, what coding styles team use, etc.</p>

          <p>The important point is that the code available now is the start of the journey. More code will be appearing, evolving, and hopefully giving back to the open source community. Getting our developers in the mindset of community development is important.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Why can&#39;t all the code be open sourced?</h2>

          <p>There is a significant proportion of our code that cannot be open sourced. Exclusions to the open source process might be based around the following:</p>

          <ul>
            <li>The DVLA has to maintain the integrity of its systems and data. Some information that is deemed useful to attackers &amp; fraudsters will remain closed source</li>
            <li>The DVLA have line of business systems that have been processing transactions for many years. They were not build with an open source ethos from the beginning. These existing systems are not run or maintained by the new project teams. It is unclear whether this code will ever transition to open source for contractual reasons and the effort associated with splitting the system into open and closed parts. Therefore any of the new code that exposes interfaces to legacy systems, such as API contracts (e.g. WSDL), will remain closed source. As the IT estate gets refreshed, closed source will represent a decreasing proportion of the code owned and maintained by the DVLA.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>Although much of the code is not open sourced, we try to ensure that the code should compile and tests can be run. We use <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">Travis CI</a> to verify that the code builds from Github. The status of Travis CI should be viewable from the README files from the repositories that have it enabled.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Are you using Github as your primary code repository?</h2>
          <p>No, the DVLA carries out development within protected repositories in a government data centre in UK territory. This protects the integrity of the source code, whilst publishing to github provides the best place for the open source community to view it.</p>

          <P>We review code before it is pushed out into the public domain, to ensure that it doesn't contain sensitive information.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>Can I contribute to these repositories?</h2>
          <p>Yes, absolutely. We can accept pull requests in Gitlab and merge them with our protected repository, after a review has taken place. DVLA to retain the right to not accept changes if they alter the code in a way which is incompatible with its goals.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
          <h2>What licence is the code?</h2>
          <p>The MIT licence is used for most code, which is a very permissive licence without any copyleft requirements like the GPL. Please check the root of the repository you intent to use for its specific licence.</p>
        </div>
