**TL:DR Capture full-length webpage screenshots using built in Developer Tools.**

Sometimes when developing a webpage you may need to send screenshots back and forth between members of your squad or business.

When doing this it is important that you capture the full webpage in order to really display what you're working on. Which is why introducing simple devtools may be of use.

In order to do this you will need to open your browser of choice and navigate to the page you would like to capture.

## Google Chrome
1. Once on the page you would like to capture you should firstly access Developer Tools by clicking `Cmd` + `Opt` + `I` *(on Mac)* or `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `I` *(on Windows)*

4. Select Capture full size screenshot, and Chrome will automatically save a full-page screenshot to your Downloads folder as a png and it will generate the name based off the webpage's URL.
